				<p>Very often political finance information is not available, so creative projects have sprung up to crowdsource information or connect the dots by using other available datasets.</p>
				<p>The second session of our webinar series will introduce ways technology can be exploited to monitor election spendings or explore undue influence on the decision-making process. We will also identify examples of inspiring and innovative things that agencies/local governments are doing in this space, projects that might be set as examples to other governments. Lastly, we will discuss possible ways of advocating for enhanced data disclosure in political finance and introduce some of the existing advocacy materials.</p>
